'Compiling the program'

Go in algorithmProject/src folder for java code and Makefile written by me.

Staying within that directory, run make command, There are two possibilities:
1): You get the error "make: Nothing to be done for `default'". The reason for this is that code is already compiled and ready to run. To recompile, first run 'make clean' and then run 'make'.

2): You get following warning but compilation is successful

Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for errors due to deprecation for details.
The reason for this warnings is that we have overriden some methods and it gives warnings in linux terminal but not in IDE . For the sake of this project, this is not an issue and such warnings can be ignored. In this case, compilation is however successful.

'Running the program'

Once the compilation is successful, following command can be written to run it (Make sure you are in same src directory):
	
COMMAND:	java Main input.txt
	where Main. java has the main method and "input.txt" is the file that has to be checked and is passed with args[0] arguments through the command line terminal.

*Simplified Steps:
1. go to algorithmProject/src
2. make
3.copy .txt file that we wantto check for the intervals.
3. java Main filename.txt eg. here we have used input.txt file in src folder so the command we have used is java Main input.txt.
