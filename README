
'Compiling the program'

Go in SimulationAssignment/src folder for java code and Makefile written by me.

Staying within that directory, run make command, There are two possibilities:
1): You get the error "make: Nothing to be done for `default'". The reason for this is that code is already compiled and ready to run. To recompile, first run 'make clean' and then run 'make'.

2): You get following warning but compilation is successful
Note: com/distributedcomputing/sandeep/Main.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
The reason for this warning is, i have used thread.stop() method in Main to stop detection nodes. For the sake of this assignment, this is not a major issue and such warnings can be ignored. In this case, compilation is however successful.

'Running the program'

Once the compilation is successful, following command can be written to run it (Make sure you are in same src directory):
	
	java -cp . com.distributedcomputing.sandeep.Main

You can run above command multiple times and observe different outputs. My analysis of results is discussed in report.

'Running the program by chaning probabilities'
Open Main file by following command:
nano com/distributedcomputing/sandeep/Main.java
At lines 12 through 14, you can change the probabilites (Note that the sum of probabilities should be equal to 1; otherwise you will get an error). 
After changing the probabilities save the file by doing CTRL+X, then typing Y and finally pressing Enter. 

Repeat the compilation and run methodology discussed above.
